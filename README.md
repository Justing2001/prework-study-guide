## Description

This project is designed around developing a relatively basic webpage using the fundamentals of web development. The web page I developed while completing this project gives insight into using HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. Which are the back bone to creating any website or web application. This project has really helped progress my learning and makes me feel comfortable going into the actual course knowing that I now have the necessary tools to succeed.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Loading into the webpage you will be greeted with some very helpful notes on HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. Although simple, these small tips can help build the foundation of knowledge going into this field. Using the DevTools console, we can inspect the backend of the webpage to get a look at the Javascript function that is running in the background.
